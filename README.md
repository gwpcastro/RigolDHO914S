# RigolDHO914S
This repository aims to describe and implement Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI) communication over the Universal Serial Bus (USB) with the Rigol DHO914S oscilloscope to acquire low-noise, high-resolution Bode diagrams for the analysis of signals and systems.

The Rigol DHO914S is a 12-bit digital oscilloscope with a maximum analog bandwidth of 125 MHz and four analog input channels. It features a real-time sampling rate of up to 1.25 GSa/s and a memory depth of 50 Mpts. The device integrates several advanced functions, including an arbitrary function generator (AFG), Bode plot analysis, histogram measurements, digital signal analysis, and more.

One of the problems encountered in here was due to the bode plot diagram.
